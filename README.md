The Challenge: What works and what doesn't with this chart? How can you make it better? 

Dataset included two files from Bridges for Prosperity, one with global indicators and another with bridges 


Background from the B2P Makeover brief: 
Bridges to Prosperity is an organization that aims to build (literal) bridges in areas that suffer from rural isolation. Rural isolation has many consequences: it decreases access "healthcare, education, and economic opportunities." Bridges to Prosperity currently has built over 300 bridges in 20 countries. According to B2P, the footbridges have increased labor by over a third, farm profits by three quarters, and the number of women in the wage labor force by more than half.
